# Pattern Matching

This project is used to check whether the input strings match a given pattern.
This project is programmed in *Python3* and involves a subject in **the Theory of Formal Languages and Automata** field.


## How this script works:
* You are to provide a text and a pattern to the input and the program checks whether the given string is compatible with the pattern or not.
* The string may only contain lower-case English letters and the pattern may only contain lower-case English letters, *?* and _*_ where ? stands for an arbitrary letter and * stands for a variable pattern.
